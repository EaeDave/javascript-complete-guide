// Create two variables: One that holds a fictional user input (a number of your choice) and one that holds no value initially (e.g. "result").
let userInput = 23;

// Set the result variable to 18 plus the value stored in user input.
result = 18 + userInput;

// Add three additional lines of code where you change the result variable again (by subtracting a value of your choice, multiplying it and dividing it).

// No!
